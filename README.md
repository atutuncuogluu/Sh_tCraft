# Sh_tCraft
This is my journey to understand PyOpenGL and my homework, and this is Sh_tCraft created using only PyOpenGL and a bit of Pygame (actually, I use Pygame in just one function). The challenge here is that almost all operations were performed using PyOpenGL.
There's no specific plan or project; that's why if you don't understand the functions and what they do, it's quite natural.<span style="color:red;">***This is actually one of the worst codes I've written so far***</span>, but the project had to be completed, and most importantly, it works! :)
